My name is Carlo Vanoni, and I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Department of Physics](https://phy.princeton.edu) of Princeton University. I am part of the [Complex Materials Theory Group](https://torquato.princeton.edu) directed by Prof. [Salvatore Torquato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Torquato), and I am advised by Prof. [Paul J. Steinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Steinhardt). 

I obtained a PhD cum laude in Statistical Physics from SISSA - International School for Advanced Studies (Trieste) in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Andrea Gambassi](https://www.statphys.sissa.it/wordpress/?page_id=1714) and Prof. [Antonello Scardicchio](https://www.ictp.it/member/antonello-scardicchio#biography).

Research Interests
======
I am interested in a variety of topics in quantum condensed matter and statistical physics, including:
- Anderson and many-body localization
- Hyperuniform disordered systems and their physical properties
- Quantum dynamics in many-body systems
- Ergodicity breaking in random matrices
