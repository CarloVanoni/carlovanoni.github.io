Title: Interface dynamics in the 2D quantum Ising model

Abstract: I will show how the melting of a smooth interface in the 2D quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields shows signs of localization. This is done by means of a “holographic” mapping to a 1D integrable model of fermions in the large ferromagnetic coupling J limit and after the systematic introduction of 1/J corrections. I will also discuss the scenario in the presence of a random external field.
