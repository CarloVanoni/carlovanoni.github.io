Title: Dynamical properties of dense disordered stealthy hyperuniform packings

Abstract: By using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that includes a soft-core repulsion between particles over and above the standard stealthy pair potential, we create a new class of disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) packings. Compared to those without soft-core repulsions, these newly obtained packings have much higher high packing fractions that span a wide range of structures, depending on the degree of stealthiness. Here, for the first time, we investigate the physical properties of such dense SHU packings, including the effective dynamic dielectric constant and time-dependent diffusion spreadability.
