Title: Dynamics of interfaces in the two-dimentional quantum Ising model

Abstract: In this short talk, I will show how the melting of a sufficiently smooth interface in the 2D quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields shows signs of localization. This is done by means of a “holographic” mapping to a 1D integrable model of fermions in the large ferromagnetic coupling J limit and after the systematic introduction of 1/J corrections. Based on Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 120601 (2022) Phys. Rev. B 107, 024306 (2023)
