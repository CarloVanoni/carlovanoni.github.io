Title: Renormalization group beta-function for Anderson and many-body localization

Abstract: This talk aims to provide a different viewpoint on localization transitions induced by disorder based on the renormalization group formalism. I will first discuss, on general grounds, the various types of scaling behaviors a localization critical point can display. I will then move to specific models; firstly, I will discuss Anderson localization in finite dimensional space and how one recovers the Anderson model on expander graphs by taking the limit of infinite dimensions. I will then move to many-body localization and show that, if a many-body localized phase exists, the critical point must be described by a two-parameter scaling theory similar to Anderson localization in infinite dimensions and to the BKT transition.
