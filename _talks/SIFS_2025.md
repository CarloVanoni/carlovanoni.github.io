Title: Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy (hyperuniform) disorder ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_2V227Bqgk))

Abstract: Hyperuniform systems are materials that suppress long-wavelength density fluctuations and display unique wave transport and structural properties, intermediate between crystalline order and complete randomness. In this talk, we explore the one-dimensional Anderson model with a special class of correlated disorder known as \emph{stealthy disorder}, defined by a power spectrum that vanishes over a continuous range of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies of optical transparency in stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we analytically and numerically investigate localization phenomena in such systems. Using perturbation theory, we compute the localization length and find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size---an effective delocalization. This behavior arises from the unique multiscale correlations inherent to stealthy disorder. These analytical findings are supported by numerical simulations. Our results highlight how stealthy disorder, and more broadly hyperuniform correlations, profoundly alter localization physics in low-dimensional quantum systems.
