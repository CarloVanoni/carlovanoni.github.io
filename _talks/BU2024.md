Title: Renormalization group analysis of the Anderson transition in finite and infinite dimensions

Abstract: In this talk, I will present a modern renormalization group approach to Anderson localization. I will first introduce the well-known scaling theory by Abrahams, Anderson, Licciardello, and Ramakrishnan, and discuss how to adapt it to modern numerical techniques. I will then present the renormalization group beta function for spectral observables, discussing its properties in finite space dimensions and how the picture changes when taking the limit of infinite dimensions. The approach I will present clarifies and puts in place many known facts about the Anderson transition and explains numerical observations. We also believe it can be effective in the context of many-body localization
