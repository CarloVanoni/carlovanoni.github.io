The melting of the corner of a crystal is a classical, real-world, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics problem which has shown several connections with other branches of physics and mathematics. For a perfect, classical crystal in two and three dimensions the solution is known: The crystal melts reaching a certain asymptotic shape, which keeps expanding ballistically. In this paper, we move onto the quantum realm and show that the presence of quenched disorder slows down severely the melting process. Nevertheless, we show that there is no many-body localization transition, which could impede the crystal to be completely eroded. We prove such claim both by a perturbative argument, using the forward approximation, and via numerical simulations. At the same time we show how, despite the lack of localization, the erosion dynamics is slowed from ballistic to logarithmic, therefore pushing the complete melting of the crystal to extremely long timescales.
